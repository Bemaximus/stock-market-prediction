### Backtesting

## The Algorithms in this Backtesting Folder use Quantiacs

trendfollowing.py is the primary algorithm, with the others using other mathematical functions to guess at optimal times to buy/sell based off of previous short and long term data.   

I added some comments to clarify what is going on to help with documentation.   

A Quantiacs account was set up with email toluooshy@gmail.com and password OlinHedgefund1; this can be changed.   

Hopefully future updates will come soon.
